Bootstrap 4 plugin providing dynamic trees built from html unordered lists

The jQuery plugin `bstree` enhances the display of a tree build of unordered lists with possibilities to open or close nodes, add icons and deal with data.   
If a data provider is supplied, dynamically-added three-state checkboxes can update these data feed a control with it.   
All generated html classes are modifiable. Chevron icons (from the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) library) and label icons can be customized.   
It's also possible to update node titles dynamically and trigger an action when data is updated.

`bs-tree` currently supports Bootstrap 4.1.
